            "staticlib": "A static system library will be produced. This is different from other library outputs in that the compiler will never attempt to link to staticlib outputs. The purpose of this output type is to create a static library containing all of the local crate’s code along with all upstream dependencies. This output type will create *.a files on Linux, macOS and Windows (MinGW), and *.lib files on Windows (MSVC). This format is recommended for use in situations such as linking Rust code into an existing non-Rust application because it will not have dynamic dependencies on other Rust code.\nNote that any dynamic dependencies that the static library may have (such as dependencies on system libraries, or dependencies on Rust libraries that are compiled as dynamic libraries) will have to be specified manually when linking that static library from somewhere. The --print=native-static-libs flag may help with this.\nNote that, because the resulting static library contains the code of all the dependencies, including the standard library, and also exports all public symbols of them, linking the static library into an executable or shared library may need special care. In case of a shared library the list of exported symbols will have to be limited via e.g. a linker or symbol version script, exported symbols list (macOS), or module definition file (Windows). Additionally, unused sections can be removed to remove all code of dependencies that is not actually used (e.g. --gc-sections or -dead_strip for macOS).",
            "cdylib": " A dynamic system library will be produced. This is used when compiling a dynamic library to be loaded from another language. This output type will create *.so files on Linux, *.dylib files on macOS, and *.dll files on Windows.",
            "rlib": "A “Rust library” file will be produced. This is used as an intermediate artifact and can be thought of as a “static Rust library”. These rlib files, unlike staticlib files, are interpreted by the compiler in future linkage. This essentially means that rustc will look for metadata in rlib files like it looks for metadata in dynamic libraries. This form of output is used to produce statically linked executables as well as staticlib outputs.",
            "proc-macro": "The output produced is not specified, but if a -L path is provided to it then the compiler will recognize the output artifacts as a macro and it can be loaded for a program. Crates compiled with this crate type must only export procedural macros. The compiler will automatically set the proc_macro configuration option. The crates are always compiled with the same target that the compiler itself was built with. For example, if you are executing the compiler from Linux with an x86_64 CPU, the target will be x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu even if the crate is a dependency of another crate being built for a different target."
